For my challenge enhancement, I made mine 2 player co-operative (or one multi-tasking player).
One uses WASD, the other up, down, left, right.

The board now generates 2 pieces, one to the left, and one to the right of the board.
They cannot cross the middle.
Drop button drops both pieces.
New pieces generate together (at same time).

I implemented this by writing new functions for moving and placing the second piece, and mapped those to the arrow keys.
I also added a parameter to piece, which keeps track of which is to the left, and which to the right, and checks for the middle boundary.
I adjusted some functions to process both pieces at once, such as "run" and "drop_all_the_way" which drops both pieces simultaneously.
